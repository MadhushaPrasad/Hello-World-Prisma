## A Next-Generation ORM:Â Prisma

Prisma is an open-source next-generation ORM. It consists of the following parts:
Prisma Client: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
Prisma Migrate: Migration system
Prisma Studio: GUI to view and edit data in your database

Prisma Client can be used in any Node.js (supported versions) or TypeScript backend application (including serverless applications and microservices). This can be a REST API, a GraphQL API, a gRPC API, or anything else that needs a database.
